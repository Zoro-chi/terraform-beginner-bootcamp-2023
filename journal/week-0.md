## Terraform Basics

### Terraform Registry

Terraform sources their providers and modules from the Terraform registry which located at [registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io/)

- **Providers** is an interface to APIs that will allow to create resources in terraform.
- **Modules** are a way to make large amount of terraform code modular, portable and sharable.

### Terraform Console

We can see a list of all the Terrform commands by simply typing `terraform`


#### Terraform Init

At the start of a new terraform project we will run `terraform init` to download the binaries for the terraform providers that we'll use in this project.

#### Terraform Plan

`terraform plan`

This will generate out a changeset, about the state of our infrastructure and what will be changed.

We can output this changeset ie. "plan" to be passed to an apply, but often you can just ignore outputting.

#### Terraform Apply

`terraform apply`

This will run a plan and pass the changeset to be execute by terraform. Apply should prompt yes or no.

If we want to automatically approve an apply we can provide the auto approve flag eg. `terraform apply --auto-approve`

#### Terraform Destroy

`teraform destroy`
This will destroy resources.

### Terraform Lock Files

`.terraform.lock.hcl` contains the locked versioning for the providers or modulues that should be used with this project.

The Terraform Lock File **should be committed** to your Version Control System (VSC) eg. Github

### Terraform State Files

`.terraform.tfstate` contain information about the current state of your infrastructure.

This file **should not be commited** to your VCS.

This file can contain sensentive data.

If you lose this file, you lose knowning the state of your infrastructure.

`.terraform.tfstate.backup` is the previous state file state.

### Terraform Directory

`.terraform` directory contains binaries of terraform providers.

## Automated generating Terraform Cloud Credentials

Automated login with this script:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

#PWD Dir
PWD=$(pwd)
touch $PWD/.terraform.d/

# Define target directory and file
TARGET_DIR="$PWD/.terraform.d"
TARGET_FILE="${TARGET_DIR}/credentials.tfrc.json"

# Check if TERRAFORM_CLOUD_TOKEN is set
if [ -z "$TERRAFORM_CLOUD_TOKEN" ]; then
    echo "Error: TERRAFORM_CLOUD_TOKEN environment variable is not set."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if directory exists, if not, create it
if [ ! -d "$TARGET_DIR" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$TARGET_DIR"
fi

# Generate credentials.tfrc.json with the token
cat > "$TARGET_FILE" << EOF
{
  "credentials": {
    "app.terraform.io": {
      "token": "$TERRAFORM_CLOUD_TOKEN"
    }
  }
}
EOF

echo "${TARGET_FILE} has been generated."
```
